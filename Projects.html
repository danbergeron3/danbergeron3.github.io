        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>This assignment involved setting up a checkers board for a checkers game. 
          It did not require the addition of the actual game play mechanics, but it 
          did require the development of an interactive highlight feature. Whenever 
          a player moused over a piece the background becomes yellow. I was able to 
          get all these features working properly. The key takes aways from this program 
          for me was learning from past mistakes. In Sokoban I did not make the background 
          static which caused me problems down the road. In this program I created the 
          checkerboard/background in the constructor. After this I did not have to worry 
          about losing visuals when the dynamic elements were introduced, since everything 
          would be layered over this background.  In the constructor I also loaded all the
          textures into a texture into a map. This allowed me to access them at my convenience
          at anytime in my other functions. In my constructor I loaded the pieces into my
          piece matrix. Which in my head was a separate entity. In the draw function the
          checkerboard and matrix would be brought together to generate the game time board.
          It was here that I made an interesting design choice. In the class Checkers there
          existed a matrix that contained an object from the piece class. It was these
          pieces that contained all the information the game required for movement and visuals.
          I treated my board as a matrix filled with light bulbs, where a light is either on or off,
          light is visible, or it is not visible. In the same vein the entire matrix was
          filled with pieces but somewhere on while somewhere off. This was so in future 
          assignments when I needed to move a piece, I didn't actually move anything I simply
          turned one piece off and another on. This also played into the selection feature of a piece.
          A piece is either selected or it is not.  When it was turned on it communicated to the draw function
          that it needed to draw a highlight before the piece. Since this is all contained to the pieces and by extension
          the matrix they exist in, it is impossible for the user to alter the integrity of the background.
          I feel that my development of this program grew Sokoban and better channeled Object-Oriented Programing
          principles. I did run into a new problem. The problem was a result of left over input from the mouse causing extra
          input to affect the program, this was resolved by creating a clearMouseBuffer function. A simple 
          function that loops while the program picks up extra input data. </p>

        <h3>Key Elements Discussion</h3>
        <p>There are two elements that were central to this assignment, the first being the vector. I used a vector
           to create a matrix in which I placed and stored store game pieces which were crucial to this program. 
           Pieces are a class used to give each piece characteristics that allow it to interact with the checkers 
           in main as its own little interphase, that builds into the entire checkersâ€™ game. This program helped 
           me to continue to develop my understanding of object-oriented programs. And, while I did not have to 
           implement any complicated algorithms for this project, it did give me the opportunity to build off my 
           failures in the last assignments.</p>
