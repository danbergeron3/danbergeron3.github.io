              <h2>Learn about Me</h2>
              <p>The initial three years of my journey through the College of Computer Science at 
                UMass Lowell have been an exciting and transformative experience. These years laid 
                the foundation for my academic and personal growth in the field of computer science.
                During the first year, I was introduced to the core concepts of computer science. 
                I immersed myself in introductory programming courses, learning languages and algorithms
                that would serve as the building blocks for my future studies. The faculty's dedication
                to providing a strong educational base was evident, and their support was instrumental in 
                my early understanding of this dynamic field.
                As I transitioned into my second year, the curriculum became more specialized. I delved 
                deeper into subjects such as data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. This 
                phase of my education challenged me to think critically and to apply the principles I had
                learned in practical scenarios. Collaborative projects with fellow students not only 
                honed my technical skills but also instilled in me the importance of teamwork and effective communication.
                In my third year, I was presented with opportunities to gain real-world experience through
                internships programs. These experiences were invaluable in bridging the gap between
                theory and practice. I had the chance to work in professional settings, applying my knowledge to
                solve real-world problems and gaining insights into the workings of the computer science industry.<p>

              <h3>Project Documentation</h3>
              <p>My website is a reflection of my journey as a student in the world of software development. 
                I'm committing a section of this site to the documentation of the software I'm working on.
                Within this documentation section, I aim to provide information about the software's features, 
                functionalities, and how it can be utilized. It will be a go-to resource those interested in exploring my project.</p>
              <h3>Hangman</h3>
              <p>Creating an "Evil Hangman" game in C was a challenging experience. The program had to dynamically adapt the chosen word to maximize difficulty by avoiding being guessed. 
                I had to designed algorithms that tracked possible words matching revealed 
                letters, ensuring that the player always was challenged.</p>
